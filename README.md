# CNN for Image Classification

## Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying images into different categories. The project is built using [mention any specific frameworks or libraries, e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch].

## Features
- **Image Classification**: Classify images into predefined categories.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Train the CNN model from scratch and evaluate its performance.
- **Configurable Architecture**: Easily modify the architecture and parameters through configuration files.
- **Data Augmentation**: Utilize data augmentation techniques to improve model generalization.
