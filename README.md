# GAN for Image Generation

## Overview
This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate realistic images from random noise. The GAN architecture consists of two neural networks: a generator that creates images and a discriminator that evaluates their authenticity.

## Features
- **Image Generation**: Generate high-quality images from random noise.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Train the GAN model from scratch and evaluate its performance.
- **Configurable Architecture**: Easily modify the architecture and parameters through configuration files.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Scripts for loading and preprocessing datasets.
